when properties of one class is used by another class then it is called as inheritance

base class-----parent classs-----super class
derived class-----child class-----sub class

// there are 5 types of Inheritance
1---single inheritance
2---multilevel Inheritance
3----multiple Inheritance
4---Hierarchical inheritance
5---Hybrid Inheritance
